### Jobs

On each virtual machine **OpenvCloud** has an **Agent** that executes work (JumpScripts) on behalf of a central **Agent Controller**.

On the **Jobs** page all jobs are listed:

Jobs are sortable and filterable by time of occurrence, command, result and state.

Job states can be:

- **OK** for jobs that have been executed successfully
- **ERROR** for jobs that have failed
- **TIMEOUT** for jobs that have timed out
- **SCHEDULED** for jobs that have not yet run

<br/>From there, by clicking the **Start Time** of a job you navigate to the **Job Details** page:

From the **Job Details** section you can navigate to the **JumpScript Details** page, with more information such as the grid and node IDs where the job ran, roles the job ran by, the executed JumpScript, which queue the job ran on and logs from the job.

There are 4 possible queues:

- **Default** queue for all kinds of miscellaneous tasks
- **Hypervisor** queue takes on tasks related to virtual machine management
- **IO** queue is typically used for backup/restore and long IO bound related work
- **Process** is for monitoring related jobs only

<br/>From there you can click trough to the actual JumpScript that was executed:

On the **JumpScript Details** page you also get a list of all the jobs that have been using this JumpScript:

Back on the **Jobs Details** page you see the result of the JumpScript:

And below the results you see the list with logs generated by the JumpScript:

For more information on logs, see the [Logs](../Logs/Logs.md) documentation.

At the bottom of the **Jobs** page you might also see a second (possibly empty) list of jobs, this one is orchestrated by a more recent implementation of the Agent/Agent Controller concept:
