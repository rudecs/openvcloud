## Stress Tests

Also see the AYS repository on git.aydo.com: https://git.aydo.com/0-complexity/ays_stresstest

The installation of the stress test is done in two steps, using two scripts:

- [Setup the Stress Test Cloud Space with the Bootstrap script](bootstrap.md)
- [Setup the Stress Test Virtual Machines with the Setup script](setup.md)

Once setup, you will want to conduct the actual stress tests: [Running the stress tests](run_stress_testing.md).

When running into problems check the section about [Errors](errors.md).
