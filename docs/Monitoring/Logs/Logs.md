## Review Logs for User Operations & Automated Tasks

All OpenvCloud components generate log information, visible on the **Logs** page in the **Grid Portal**, as documented [here](../../GridPortal/Logs/Log.md). Each log record is related to a job. A job is actually a JumpScript triggered by user operations and automated tasks. Jobs are documented [here](../../GridPortal/Jobs/Jobs), and JumpScripts are documented [here](../../GridPortal/JumpScripts/JumpScripts.md).

Furthermore, all REST API calls, typically trigged by user operations in the various OpenvCloud web portals, are audited and made visible on the **Audit** page in the **Grid Portal**, as documented [here](../../GridPortal/Audits/Audits.md).
